\section f0 Ambient Occlusion

\section f9 Surface Reconstruction: Ball Pivoting 

Given a point cloud with normals it reconstructs a surface using the <b>Ball Pivoting Algorithm</b>.Starting with a seed triangle, the BPA algorithm  pivots a ball of the given radius around the already formed edgesuntil it touches another point, forming another triangle. The process continues until all reachable edges have been tried.This surface reconstruction algorithm uses the existing points without creating new ones. Works better with uniformly sampled point clouds. If needed first perform a poisson disk subsampling of the point cloud. <br>Bernardini F., Mittleman J., Rushmeier H., Silva C., Taubin G.<br><b>The ball-pivoting algorithm for surface reconstruction.</b><br>IEEE TVCG 1999

\section f75 Craters Generation 

Generates craters onto a mesh using radial functions.<br />
There must be at least two layers to apply this filter:<br />
<ul>
    <li>the layer that contains the target mesh; we assume that this mesh is sufficiently refined;</li>
    <li>the layer that contains the samples which represent the central points of craters.</li>
</ul>

There are three radial functions available to generate craters, two of which are Gaussian and Multiquadric,
and the third is a variant of multiquadric. Blending functions are also provided to blend
the crater elevation towards the mesh surface.
If you want the preview to work, be sure to select the target mesh layer before launching the
filter. You can select this layer by clicking on it in the layer dialog.

\section f197 Shape Diameter Function 

Calculate the SDF (<b>shape diameter function</b>) on the mesh, you can visualize the result colorizing the mesh. The SDF is a scalar function on the mesh surface and represents the neighborhood diameter of the object at each point. Given a point on the mesh surface,several rays are sent inside a cone, centered around the point's inward-normal, to the other side of the mesh. The result is a weighted sum of all rays lengths. For further details, see the reference paper:<br><b>Shapira Shamir Cohen-Or,<br>Consistent Mesh Partitioning and Skeletonisation using the shaper diamter function, Visual Comput. J. (2008)</b>

\section f199 Volumetric obscurance 

Calculates obscurance coefficients for the mesh. Obscurance is introduced to avoid the disadvantages of both classical ambient term and ambient occlusion. In ambient occlusion, totally occluded parts of the mesh are black. Instead obscurance, despite still based on a perfectly diffuse light coming from everywhere, accounts for multiple bounces of indirect illumination by means of a function of both the openness of a point and the distance to his occluder (if any). Obscurance is inversely proportional to the number of ray casted from the point that hit an occluder and proportional to the distance a ray travels before hitting the occluder. You can control how much the distance factor influences the final result with the obscurance exponenent (see help below). Obscurance is a value in the range [0,1].
